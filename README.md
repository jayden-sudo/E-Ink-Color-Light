# E-Ink Color Theme

This is a theme for e-ink color displays, such as the Dasung Paperlike Color. It is based on the 8 Bit color theme by [Zhou Qi](https://github.com/HandsomeOne/8bit).

I am working mainly with Python, C++, JSON and YAML files, so I have optimized the theme for these languages. The theme is work in progress and I will update it as I find more colors that work well on the e-ink display. If you have any suggestions, please let me know by opening an [issue](https://github.com/davidzanger/8-Bit-E-Ink-Color/issues).
